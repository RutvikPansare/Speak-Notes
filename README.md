## Inspiration
The language barrier is one of the biggest challenges in the education system today. As per estimates from Pew Research Center, almost 47% of immigrants do not speak English proficiently and more than 350 different languages are spoken in the United States. To solve this problem of the language barrier and learn new information in a more accessible way, we created SpeakNotes which not only speaks all your notes in several different languages but changes the text into your preferred language.

## What it does
Speak notes help students all across the globe to learn new things more conveniently. It is a powerful note-taking app that lets you listen to your notes like an audiobook and even change its language. Students can also share their notes with other users for knowledge sharing and collective learning.

## Application Flow
Simply create a user account on the Speak Notes app.
